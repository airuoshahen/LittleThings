# LittleThings
After working as firmware engineer for some years, I wan to write a platform. Therefore, I can put some peripheral driver, MCU drivers and protocol which are accumulated in my engineer career. After I summarized, I want them to be reused conveniently anywhere.

### Why it is named by LittleThings
Because my daughter's pet name is "xiao shi er", I choose LittleThings as name of my platform. As a firmware engineer, I think this is the best way to impress my love to her.

### Operation System
We can find so many embedded operation system, so I think it is not very wise that I write a embedded operation system. Therefore, I choose FreeRTOS as my embedded operation system. Now I need to port it. The version of FreeRTOS is 10.4.6 .
